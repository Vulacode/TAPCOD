TAPCOD was the first encryption/transmission program used by Operation Vula (1988-1992) in South Africa. It was used from 1988 until 1990, when it was superceded by TECOD.

It was written in PowerBASIC, an advanced form of the Basic programming language that was popular in the 1980s. The PowerBASIC compiler created proper EXE files to run on Microsoft MS-DOS machines.
